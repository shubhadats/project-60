        <div class="line"></div>
        <p>My hobby is playing basketball. Basketball is very fun and keeps me fit and healthy. It also makes me tall because of the stretching I do in the game. Basketball makes me hungry and tired. I don't feel stressed and I am always happy when I play baskeball.
            I am really good at basketball.I was chosen as the captain for my junior school team. </p>

        <div class="line"></div>
        <p>
            Science suggests that playing basketball can add inches to your height<br> due to the anaerobic movements and jumping during a game of basketball.<br> It allows the pituitary gland to release more growth hormones into the body causing<br> it to grow.

            Michael Jordan is an incredibly admirable and inspiring sportsman.<br> I was inspired by him when I watched his game of the 1997 NBA finals. He put together a herculean effort and played marvelously even though he was suffering from heigh fever and made his team win the game.
